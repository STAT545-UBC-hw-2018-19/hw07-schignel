STAT 545: Homework 07
=====================

### By: Stephen Chignell

Welcome to the repository! Here you'll find all the files and associated material for [Howework 7](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw07/hw07.html).

For this assignment, I chose to add a function to the `foofactors` package by Jenny Bryan (original is [here](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors)).

I sometimes have to work with messy data where there are typos and inconsistencies as a result of data entry errors, so for HW07, I wrote a function called `fclean` which goes through all of the factor levels and trims extra white space while converting each word to title case.

-   **Please access my modifed version of the `foofactors` package [here](https://github.com/schignel/foofactors)**
